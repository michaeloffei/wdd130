        <p>Ghana is a vibrant West African country known for its rich history, diverse culture, and warm hospitality.
            Famous as the first sub-Saharan African nation to gain independence in 1957, Ghana is often called the
            "Gateway to
            Africa." It is home to beautiful coastlines, historic castles, lush forests, and bustling cities like Accra
            and Kumasi. Ghanaâ€™s
            traditions are reflected in its colorful festivals, music, and dance, while its democracy and stability make
            it a
            leading nation in the region.</p>
